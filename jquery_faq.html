    <dt>How much land is protected as a National Park?</dt>
    <dd>The National Park Service protects over 84 million acres of wild landscapes and historic sites.</dd>

    <dt>Which National Park is the oldest?</dt>
    <dd>Yellowstone National Park (in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana) is the oldest U.S. national park, founded in 1872</dd>

    <dt>Is there anything big in America's National Parks?</dt>
    <dd>National parks are home to life on a big scale: Sequoia trees are some of the world's largest living things, and Alaskan brown bears are some of the world's largest carnivores.</dd>

    <dt>No... I mean big big.</dt>
    <dd>Seriously, California's Sequoia National Park is home to the largest living single-stem tree in the world, the wonderfully named General Sherman. The tree is approximately 275 feet tall and weighs approximately 1,900 metric tons.</dd>

    <dt>BIGGER!?!</dt>
    <dd>Ribbon Falls in Yosemite is nine times taller than Niagara Falls; and Death Valley National Park is the largest national park in the lower 48 U.S. states, stretching 5,300 square miles or 3.4 million acres.Is that big enough?</dd>

    <dt>Whats the deal with that geyser?</dt>
    <dd>Old Faithful erupts every 35 to 120 minutes for 1 1/2 to 5 minutes. Its maximum height ranges from 90 to 184 feet. It is not the biggest or the most regular geyser in Yellowstone but it is the biggest regular geyser.</dd>

    <dt>Are there and impressive cave systems in the National Park System?</dt>
    <dd>Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico is home to the nation's deepest cave, which is 1,593 feet deep; and Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky has the longest cave system in the world with more than 3,454 mapped miles.</dd>

    <dt>Are parks all just nature and stuff?</dt>
    <dd>National parks are actually the home to a former federal prison, Alcatraz in Golden Gate National Recreation Area, California, and a leper colony, Molokai Island Hansen's Disease Settlement in Kalaupapa National Historic Site, Hawaii.</dd>

    <dt>Are National Parks and National Monuments the same thing?</dt>
    <dd>National parks and national monuments are sometimes confused. National parks are chosen for their natural beauty, unique geological features, and unusual ecosystems.</dd>

    <dt>Is there a National PArk in every state?</dt>
    <dd>Only one state in the country is not lucky enough to currently have either a national park or national monument. It is actually the countryâ€™s first state, Delaware. </dd>
